Hi! I’m Siddhant Giri, a class 11 (PCM) student from India who’s passionate about coding, science, and building things that matter. I’m currently diving deep into web development, and I love shipping ideas fast and sharing what I learn openly.

Recently, I built [sportscsfa.in](https://www.sportscsfa.in/) from scratch—a website for a skating academy to manage students, fee payments, and more. It’s been a great journey turning real-world problems into code!

**Tagline:**  
_Code, science, and ideas—shipped fast, shared openly._

**What excites me:**  
> “We stand on the shoulders of millennia of scientific discovery—and the best part? It’s our turn to push the boundaries even further.” 🔥

Let's connect, collaborate, and push the boundaries of what we can do with code and curiosity!
